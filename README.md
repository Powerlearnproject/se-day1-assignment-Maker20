#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing and maintenance of software applications to solve real world problems. The importance of software engineering in the technology industry cannot be overstated. As technology continues to advance and play an increasingly critical role in modern life, software engineering has become a vital component of various sectors, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and education. Well-engineered software systems are essential for delivering efficient, reliable, and secure services, ultimately driving innovation and economic growth.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The birth of Software Engineering
The term "software engineering" was introduced at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968.
This milestone marked the recognition of software development as an engineering discipline, rather than just coding.
It was a response to the software crisis, where projects were failing due to increasing complexity and poor management.

The Rise of Structural Programming
The adoption of structured programming (e.g., by Edsger Dijkstra) led to better software organization.
Languages like Pascal, C, and Ada encouraged modular, readable, and maintainable code.
This helped reduce errors and improve efficiency in software development.

The emergence of Agile and DevOps
Agile methodologies (introduced in the Agile Manifesto, 2001) emphasized iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility over rigid planning.
DevOps (2010s onward) bridged the gap between development and operations, improving automation, continuous integration, and deployment (CI/CD).
These approaches enabled faster, more reliable software delivery in modern industries.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall is a sequential and rigid methodology with distinct phases that must be completed in order, while Agile is flexible and iterative, emphasizing continuous feedback and adaptation. Waterfall limits a team's ability to diverge from the project plan, and requires the completion of all tasks before any work can be released. Agile encourages teams to respond quickly and adapt.

Waterfall would be appropriate for projects with well-defined requirements and a predictable scope, such as building construction or manufacturing. Agile is better suited for projects with evolving requirements and a need for flexibility, such as software development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1. Software Developer (Software Engineer)
Role: Responsible for designing, coding, and implementing software solutions.
Key Responsibilities:
Write, test, and debug code using programming languages like Python, Java, or C++.
Develop software according to design specifications and user requirements.
Collaborate with other team members to integrate features.
Maintain and improve existing software by fixing bugs and optimizing performance.
Use version control tools (e.g., Git) to manage code changes.
Example: A software developer working on an e-commerce website may implement the shopping cart functionality.

2. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
Role: Ensures that software meets quality standards before release.
Key Responsibilities:
Design and execute test cases to find bugs and inconsistencies.
Perform manual and automated testing to ensure functionality, security, and performance.
Identify defects and report them to developers for fixes.
Work closely with developers to improve software quality.
Ensure software meets user requirements and business goals.
Example: A QA engineer testing a mobile banking app might check for security vulnerabilities and ensure transactions work correctly.

3. Project Manager (PM)
Role: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of the software project.
Key Responsibilities:
Define project scope, goals, and deliverables.
Manage project timelines, budgets, and resources.
Communicate with stakeholders and team members to ensure alignment.
Identify risks and resolve issues to keep the project on track.
Use project management tools (e.g., Jira, Trello) to track progress.
Example: A project manager overseeing a product launch ensures the team meets deadlines while balancing client requirements.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

1. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
An IDE is a software application that provides a comprehensive environment for writing, debugging, and testing code. It enhances productivity by integrating essential development tools into a single platform.
Importance of IDEs:
  Code Assistance & Autocompletion – Reduces errors and speeds up coding with intelligent suggestions.
 Debugging & Error Detection – Provides built-in debuggers to identify and fix issues.
 Integrated Build & Compilation – Allows seamless compilation and execution of code.
 Code Navigation & Refactoring – Helps in managing large projects by organizing and refactoring code efficiently.
Examples of IDEs:
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) – Lightweight, widely used, with support for multiple languages.
IntelliJ IDEA – Popular for Java development.
PyCharm – Specialized for Python development.
Eclipse – Common for Java and enterprise applications.

2. Version Control Systems (VCS)
A VCS is a tool that tracks changes in code over time, allowing multiple developers to collaborate while maintaining a history of modifications.
Importance of VCS:
 Collaboration – Enables teams to work on the same project without overwriting each other’s work.
 Version Tracking & Rollback – Allows developers to revert to previous versions if issues arise.
 Branching & Merging – Facilitates parallel development by letting teams work on different features independently.
 Backup & Security – Ensures code is stored safely and can be recovered if needed.
Examples of VCS:
Git – The most widely used distributed VCS; used with platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
SVN (Apache Subversion) – A centralized VCS used in some legacy systems.

Importance: Confirms that the product is usable, meets business needs, and is ready for deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining prompts—questions or instructions—to get specific responses from AI models like large language models (LLMs). It is an important AI engineering technique that helps refine LLMs to produce requested results.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about technology."

Improved Prompt:
"Explain three major advancements in artificial intelligence over the past five years, including their impact on industries."

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:
More Specific – Instead of a broad topic like "technology," the improved prompt focuses on "artificial intelligence advancements."
Clearly Defined Scope – It limits the response to "three major advancements" instead of an open-ended answer.
Timeframe Included – Specifying "over the past five years" ensures relevant and recent information.
Adds Context – Asking for the "impact on industries" provides a meaningful direction for the response.
